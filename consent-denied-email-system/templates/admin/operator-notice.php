    <p>This is a formal notice regarding the above vehicle and any future parking on land managed by your organization.</p>

    <h3>NOTICE OF NON-ACCEPTANCE AND COUNTER-OFFER</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>I DO NOT accept or consent to any terms involving disproportionate "parking charges," "penalty charges," or similar fees that may appear on your signage or documentation.</li>

        <li>Instead, I propose the following alternative terms for any parking by the above vehicle:
            <ul>
                <li>Payment of reasonable parking fees at the standard hourly/daily rate for the location</li>
                <li>In cases of overstay, payment of the standard rate plus 20% administrative fee</li>
                <li>All charges to be clearly evidenced and proportionate to actual losses</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>By allowing the above vehicle to enter and park on any land under your management after receipt of this notice, you agree to accept these alternative terms.</li>

        <li>This notice applies to all current and future parking instances by the above vehicle.</li>

        <li>Any attempt to impose different terms will constitute a breach of this agreement.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Please retain this notice on your records. This communication has been logged and timestamped in our system.</p>

    <p>Yours faithfully,<br>
